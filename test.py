Path Planning Using Particle Swarm Optimization

Implementation of particle swarm optimization (PSO) for path planning when the
environment is known.

Copyright (c) 2021 Gabriele Gilardi

Features
--------
- The code has been written and tested in Python 3.8.5.
- Four types of obstacles: circle, ellipse, convex polygon, generic polygon.
- Start position, goal position, and obstacles can be dynamically changed to
  simulate motion.
- Penalty function of type 1/d with the center in the obstacle centroid.
- To improve the execution speed, the algorithms to determine if a point is
  inside an obstacle have been designed to carry out the determination on all
  points simultaneously.
- Points on the obstacle borders/edges are not considered inside the obstacle.
- Option to run sequential tests with different initial conditions to increase
  the chances to find a global minimum.
- Usage: python test.py <example>.

Main Parameters
---------------
example
    Number of the example to run (1, 2, or 3.)
start
    Start coordinates.
goal
    Goal coordinates.
limits
    Lower and upper boundaries of the map and search space in the PSO.
nRun
    Number of runs.
nPts >= 2
    Number of internal points defining the spline. The number of variables is
    twice this number.
d >= 2
    Number of segments between the spline breakpoints.
nPop >=1, epochs >= 1
    Number of agents (population) and number of iterations.
f_interp = slinear, quadratic, cubic
    Order of the spline (1st, 2nd and 3rd order, respectively.)
Xinit
    Initial value of the variables. Set Xinit=None to pick them randomly. This
    array is organized with first the x-coordinates of all internal points and
    then the y-coordinates of all internal points.
K >= 0
    Average size of each agent's group of informants. If K=0 the entire swarm
    is used as agent's group of informants.
phi >= 2
    Coefficient to calculate the self-confidence and the confidence-in-others
    coefficients.
vel_fact > 0
    Velocity factor to calculate the max. and min. allowed velocities.
conf_type = HY, RB, MX
    Confinement on the velocities: hyperbolic, random-back, mixed.
IntVar
    List of indexes specifying which variable should be treated as integer.
    If all variables are real set IntVar=None, if all variables are integer
    set IntVar='all'.
normalize = True, False
    Specifies if the search space should be normalized.
0 < rad < 1
    Normalized radius of the hypersphere centered on the best particle. The
    higher the number of other particles inside and the better is the solution.

Examples
--------
There are three examples, all of them using the same obstacles:

Example 1
- Multiple runs, cubic spline, optimizer initialized randomly.
- See <Results_Figure_1.png> for the full results.

Example 2
- Multiple runs, quadratic spline, optimizer initialized with the straight line
  between start and goal position.
- See <Results_Example_2.png> for the full results.

Example 3
- Single run, linear spline, optimizer initialized with the previous solution,
  start point chasing a moving goal with one obstacle (the circle) also moving.
- See <Results_Example_3.gif> for the full animation.
